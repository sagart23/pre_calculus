# AP Precalculus Notes

Welcome, AP Precalculus students!

This repository contains interactive study notes and tools for our class. You can use these notebooks to review concepts, experiment with graphs, and prepare for exams.

### How to use these notes

To get started, simply click the **"launch binder"** button below. This will open a live, interactive version of the notes in your web browser. You don't need to install any software!

Once the notebook loads, you can read the notes, run the code cells to generate graphs, and even change the values in the code to see how the graphs change.

I hope you find these notes helpful for your studies. Happy learning!
